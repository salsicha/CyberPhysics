I need to implement a ROS publisher in C++.
Key requirements:
1. The script will use smbus2, and ozzmaker libraries MMC5983MA and LSM6DSL to read the accelerometer and gyroscope data from the ozzmaker board.
2. The script will use the gps python library to read the GPS data from the ozzmaker board.
3. The script will publish the Imu and GPS messages using rclpy.
4. The script will publish at 200 Hz.
Please consider:
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Best practices for python and rclpy
Please do not unnecessarily remove any comments or code.
Generate the code with clear comments explaining the logic.
