Python based quadcopter flight controller.

Original source code here:

TODO:
The original MicroPython code was converted with Qwen2.5-coder
It was converted to Python and the Raspberry Pi GPIO library,
and then converted to Cython

Needs testing...


## Raspberry Pi 5 fix:

```bash
sudo apt remove python3-rpi.gpio
sudo apt install python3-rpi-lgpio
```
