def get_location_metres(original_location, dNorth, dEast):

    Returns a LocationGlobal object containing the latitude/longitude `dNorth` and `dEast` metres from the
    specified `original_location`. The returned LocationGlobal has the same `alt` value
    as `original_location`.

    The function is useful when you want to move the vehicle around specifying locations relative to
    the current vehicle position.

    The algorithm is relatively accurate over small distances (10m within 1km) except close to the poles.
