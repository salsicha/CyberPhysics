# TODO: implement visual odometry for the Oak-1 camera.
# The output will be unscaled/non-metric depth.
# Then publish the depth map as a ROS topic.
# Another ros node will fuse IMU and depth map to produce a scaled/metric depth map.
# The navigation stack will use the metric depth map for obstacle avoidance and path planning.
