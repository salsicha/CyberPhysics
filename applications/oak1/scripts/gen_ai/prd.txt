I need to implement a ROS publisher in C++.
Key requirements:
1. The script will use depthai to do feature tracking on the Oak-1 mono camera.
2. The script will use the ROS2 to publish the tracked features.
Please consider:
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Best practices for C++ and ROS2
Please do not unnecessarily remove any comments or code.
Generate the code with clear comments explaining the logic.
